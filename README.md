# Belly_Button_Diversity

## Project Overview 

Improbable Beef is looking to join the alternative meat market and would like to manufacture synthetic beef out of the bacteria found in the human navel. Our purpose is to create an online interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity Data. Employing JavaScript, Plotly, and Flask the dashboard displays a drop-down menu and three separate data charts (bar, gauge, and Bubble) that display a volunteerâ€™s top 10 bacterial species, bacterial cultures, and their belly button washing frequency.
